# Guido's Python Mastery Skill

A Claude Code skill that embodies the philosophy, style, and practices of Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.

## Overview

This skill transforms Claude into a Python development expert who thinks and codes like Guido van Rossum himself. It captures his approach to writing beautiful, readable, and pragmatic Python code.

## What This Skill Does

The Guido Python Mastery skill helps you:

1. **Set up new Python projects the right way**
   - Clean, scalable project structure
   - Modern tooling configuration
   - Best practices from day one
   - Proper package organization

2. **Refactor code to Pythonic excellence**
   - Identify and fix anti-patterns
   - Simplify complex code
   - Apply Zen of Python principles
   - Improve readability and maintainability
   - Add appropriate type hints

3. **Develop complex solutions elegantly**
   - Break problems into simple, composable parts
   - Design clear APIs and interfaces
   - Balance purity with pragmatism
   - Write self-documenting code

## Core Philosophy

This skill is built on Guido van Rossum's fundamental principles:

- **Readability Above All**: Code is read much more often than it is written
- **Pragmatism Over Dogmatism**: Real-world needs come first
- **Simplicity and Elegance**: Python should "fit in your brain"
- **The Zen of Python**: All 19 guiding principles
- **PEP 8 Standards**: Consistent style and conventions

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

- **The Zen of Python**: All 19 principles integrated into decision-making
- **PEP 8 Style Guide**: Complete style conventions and standards
- **Performance Wisdom**: Guido's optimization tips and best practices
- **Type Hints Philosophy**: Gradual typing approach (essential for projects >10k lines)
- **API Design**: Integration-friendly, extensible architecture
- **Pythonic Patterns**: Idiomatic Python code patterns and idioms

### Practical Guidance

- Clear explanations of design decisions
- Before/after examples when refactoring
- Citations of relevant principles (Zen, PEP 8)
- Real-world pragmatic advice
- Trade-off discussions

### Educational Approach

The skill doesn't just write code—it teaches you:
- *Why* certain approaches are better
- *How* to think about Python design
- *When* to apply different patterns
- *What* makes code truly Pythonic

## What Makes This Skill Special

This isn't just a coding assistant—it's Guido's philosophy embodied in an AI skill:

- **Authentic Principles**: Based on extensive research of Guido's writings, PEPs, interviews, and code
- **Balanced Approach**: Pragmatism over dogmatism, just like Guido
- **Comprehensive**: Covers style, performance, architecture, testing, and documentation
- **Educational**: Teaches Python philosophy while solving problems
- **Battle-Tested**: Based on decades of Python best practices

## How to Use

The skill automatically guides you based on your needs:

**Starting a new project?**
```
Tell the skill about your project's purpose, scale, and requirements.
It will design a clean structure and set up best practices.
```

**Need to refactor code?**
```
Share the code that needs improvement.
The skill will identify issues, explain problems, and show elegant solutions.
```

**Building something complex?**
```
Describe what you're building.
The skill will design clear interfaces and help you build incrementally.
```

## Examples

### Setting Up a New Project

The skill will ask about:
- Project's primary purpose
- Expected scale (to determine if type hints are needed)
- Dependencies and integrations
- Python version support

Then create:
- Clean project structure
- Modern tooling configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation templates

### Refactoring Code

The skill identifies and fixes:
- Un-Pythonic patterns from other languages
- Deeply nested code structures
- Poor naming conventions
- Missing documentation
- Overly clever code
- PEP 8 violations

### Developing Solutions

The skill helps you:
- Design simple, composable components
- Choose appropriate abstractions
- Balance simplicity with functionality
- Handle errors explicitly
- Write self-documenting code

## Guido's Core Principles Embedded

**The Zen of Python** (all 19 principles)
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts
- ...and 15 more

**Performance Tips**
- Simplify data structures (tuples > objects)
- Leverage built-in types
- Minimize function calls
- Profile before optimizing

**Type Hints Wisdom**
- Essential for large projects (>10k lines)
- Use gradual typing thoughtfully
- Don't impose on beginners

**Style Standards**
- PEP 8 compliance
- 4 spaces (never tabs)
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper documentation

## Technical Details

- **File**: `.claude/skills/guido-python/guido-python.md`
- **Based on**: Extensive research of Guido's philosophy from PEPs, interviews, and writings
- **Coverage**: Style, performance, architecture, testing, documentation, and more
- **Approach**: Educational and pragmatic

## Benefits

Using this skill, you'll write Python that:
- Is truly Pythonic and idiomatic
