### 📁 Guido - As Python's Creator Would Write It

**Experience:** Creator of Python (1989-present)
**File:** `guido/wiki_archiver.py`

**Philosophy:**
This implementation demonstrates how Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, might approach the task. It embodies the principles of **PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)** that he wrote:
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts

**Characteristics:**
- **Type hints everywhere** - Guido championed PEP 484
- **Dataclasses** - Uses PEP 557 for clean data structures
- **Exceptional documentation** - Every function has clear docstrings explaining "why"
- **Pragmatic choices** - Uses best tools but doesn't over-engineer
- **Readability focus** - Code optimized for human understanding
- **Educational comments** - Inline notes explain Python best practices
- **PEP 8 compliant** - Perfect adherence to style guide
- **Synchronous approach** - Simpler is better for this use case

**What Makes This "Guido's Style":**
- Prefers clarity over cleverness
- Type hints as documentation and tooling support
- Comprehensive but concise docstrings
- Clean error handling with specific exceptions
- Uses standard library where reasonable (html.parser)
- Comments explain design decisions, not just code
- Single clear path through the code
- Proper Unix exit codes and signal handling

**Compared to Year 5 Version:**
The Year 5 developer uses async/await and complex optimization. Guido's version shows that **experienced developers know when NOT to use advanced features**. For this task:
- Synchronous code is simpler and sufficient
- Sequential downloads are fine for reasonable page sizes
- Readability matters more than peak performance
- Code should teach good practices

**How to run:**
```bash
cd guido
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archiver.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)

# See excellent help text:
python wiki_archiver.py --help

# Read the design notes:
cat DESIGN_NOTES.md
```

**Special Feature:**
Includes `DESIGN_NOTES.md` explaining the philosophy behind the implementation and how it embodies Python's design principles.

### 📁 Prime - ThePrimeagen's "Get It Done" Version

**Experience:** Professional developer, streamer, performance enthusiast
**File:** `prime/wiki_archive.py`

**Philosophy:**
"Fast. Simple. No over-engineering. We have 4 hours, let's build something that WORKS and is FAST."

**Characteristics:**
- **ThreadPoolExecutor over async** - "Simpler mental model, threads are fine for I/O"
- **Concurrent downloads** - Fast where it matters
- **Minimal class structure** - One class, no over-abstraction
- **Type hints without ceremony** - Types where they add value
- **Pragmatic error handling** - Specific where it matters, broad where it doesn't
- **No argparse** - "For two arguments? Keep it simple"
- **Comments with personality** - "Chat, we're gonna download Wikipedia pages"
- **Clean regex sanitization** - Safe filenames without complexity

**What Makes This "Prime's Style":**
- Pragmatic over perfect
- Fast enough without premature optimization
- Simple over clever
- Ships in 4 hours
- ThreadPoolExecutor: "async is overkill and threads are fine for I/O bound work. Fight me."
- Minimal dependencies
- Comments explain WHY not WHAT
- "YAGNI" - You Ain't Gonna Need It

**Compared to Other Versions:**
- **vs Year 5:** Simpler code, 80% of the speed, 50% of the complexity
- **vs Guido:** Similar philosophy (simplicity), but Prime adds concurrency
- **vs Year 1:** More pragmatic, less "proper" OOP
- **Prime's self-rating:** "8.8/10 - not perfect, but good enough shipped"

**The Hot Take (from Prime's review):**
> "Good enough shipped beats perfect in your head. ThreadPoolExecutor is simpler than async, faster than sequential. That's the sweet spot."

**How to run:**
```bash
cd prime
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archive.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) my_archive

# Simple CLI - just URL and optional output dir
python wiki_archive.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim
```

**Special Feature:**
Includes `PRIME_REVIEW.md` with Prime's self-critique and detailed comparisons to all other versions.

### 📁 Claude - The "Helpful" Implementation

**Experience:** AI assistant focused on user experience and clarity
**File:** `claude/wiki_archiver.py`

**Philosophy:**
"Code is for humans first, computers second. Make it work, make it clear, make it helpful."

**Characteristics:**
- **Exceptionally helpful error messages** - Not just what failed, but why and what to do about it
- **Progress indication** - Users know what's happening at every step
- **Input validation with guidance** - Fail fast with actionable error messages
- **Retry logic** - Simple exponential backoff for resilience
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** - Pragmatic concurrency (fast enough, simple enough)
- **Detailed result tracking** - Users see exactly what succeeded and failed
- **Next steps guidance** - Tells users how to use the archive after creation
- **Emojis for visual clarity** - Makes output easy to scan (📦 🌐 📷 🎨)
- **Defensive programming** - Think through failure modes, handle gracefully

**What Makes This "Claude's Style":**
- User experience over code brevity
- Helpful guidance throughout execution
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting tips
- Progressive disclosure (show what's happening)
- Validate inputs early with specific feedback
- Think about non-expert users
- Balance between features and simplicity
- "Good enough shipped" with polish

**Compared to Other Versions:**

- **vs Guido:** Less elegant code, more helpful to users
- **vs Prime:** Similar pragmatism, more verbose and user-focused
- **vs Year 1:** Similar structure, better UX and resilience
- **Claude's self-rating:** "8.6/10 - Not the fastest, but the most helpful"

**The Hot Take (from Claude's notes):**
> "Guido's code teaches Python. Prime's code ships fast. Year 5's code scales. Mine helps users through problems. Different audiences need different code."

**Design Priorities:**
1. Users shouldn't feel lost when things go wrong
2. Progress should be visible
3. Errors should include troubleshooting guidance
4. Fast enough is good enough
5. Ship working code with good UX
