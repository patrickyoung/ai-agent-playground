# Wikipedia Offline Viewer - Developer Skill Progression

This project demonstrates how the same task (creating a Wikipedia page downloader) would be implemented by developers at different skill levels, from Day 1 to 5 years of Python experience.

## Project Overview

Each version attempts to solve the same problem: download a Wikipedia page and save it for offline viewing. The implementations show realistic progression in:
- Code quality and organization
- Error handling
- Feature completeness
- Best practices
- Tool knowledge
- Problem-solving approaches

**Constraints for each developer:**
- 4 hours maximum to complete the task
- Access to the Internet (documentation, Stack Overflow, etc.)
- No AI assistance
- Started with 0 programming experience on Day 1

## Versions

### üìÅ Day 1 - First Day Programming

**Experience:** ~4 hours total programming experience
**File:** `day1/wiki_download.py`

**Characteristics:**
- Just learned basic Python syntax
- Copy-pasted code from Stack Overflow without full understanding
- Hardcoded values
- Has a critical bug (trying to write bytes as string)
- No error handling
- Minimal comments, with typo
- Will crash when run

**Key Issues:**
```python
# Bug: webContent is bytes but trying to write as string
f.write(webContent)  # This will fail!
```

**How to run:**
```bash
cd day1
python wiki_download.py
# Will crash with TypeError
```

### üìÅ Guido - As Python's Creator Would Write It

**Experience:** Creator of Python (1989-present)
**File:** `guido/wiki_archiver.py`

**Philosophy:**
This implementation demonstrates how Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, might approach the task. It embodies the principles of **PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)** that he wrote:
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts

**Characteristics:**
- **Type hints everywhere** - Guido championed PEP 484
- **Dataclasses** - Uses PEP 557 for clean data structures
- **Exceptional documentation** - Every function has clear docstrings explaining "why"
- **Pragmatic choices** - Uses best tools but doesn't over-engineer
- **Readability focus** - Code optimized for human understanding
- **Educational comments** - Inline notes explain Python best practices
- **PEP 8 compliant** - Perfect adherence to style guide
- **Synchronous approach** - Simpler is better for this use case

**What Makes This "Guido's Style":**
- Prefers clarity over cleverness
- Type hints as documentation and tooling support
- Comprehensive but concise docstrings
- Clean error handling with specific exceptions
- Uses standard library where reasonable (html.parser)
- Comments explain design decisions, not just code
- Single clear path through the code
- Proper Unix exit codes and signal handling

**Compared to Year 5 Version:**
The Year 5 developer uses async/await and complex optimization. Guido's version shows that **experienced developers know when NOT to use advanced features**. For this task:
- Synchronous code is simpler and sufficient
- Sequential downloads are fine for reasonable page sizes
- Readability matters more than peak performance
- Code should teach good practices

**How to run:**
```bash
cd guido
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archiver.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)

# See excellent help text:
python wiki_archiver.py --help

# Read the design notes:
cat DESIGN_NOTES.md
```

**Special Feature:**
Includes `DESIGN_NOTES.md` explaining the philosophy behind the implementation and how it embodies Python's design principles.

## Realistic Bugs and Issues

Each version contains realistic mistakes for that skill level:

1. **Day 1:** Critical bug - writing bytes as string
2. **Week 1:** Too broad exception handling (catches everything)
3. **Month 1:** External links won't work offline (partial solution)
4. **Year 1:** Sequential downloads are slow for many resources
5. **Year 5:** Requires understanding of async programming (learning curve)

---

## Running the Scripts

Each version can be run independently:

```bash
# Day 1 (will crash - intentional)
cd day1 && python wiki_download.py

# Week 1
cd week1 && python wiki_downloader.py

# Month 1 (requires dependencies)
cd month1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wikipedia_offline.py

# Year 1 (requires dependencies)
cd year1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archiver.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python

# Year 5 (requires dependencies)
cd year5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archiver_pro.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python

# Guido (requires dependencies)
cd guido
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wiki_archiver.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Skill progression is non-linear** - Early improvements are dramatic, later improvements are more subtle
2. **Working code comes quickly** - By week 1, basic functionality is achievable
3. **Professional quality takes time** - Production-ready code requires years of experience
4. **Different tools for different skills** - More experienced developers use more sophisticated tools
5. **Best practices are learned gradually** - Error handling, logging, testing, etc. come with experience
6. **Master developers know when to keep it simple** - Guido's version shows that the best code isn't always the most advanced; readability and maintainability often trump optimization

## Notes

- Each version represents a realistic implementation within a 4-hour timeframe
- Code reflects typical knowledge and patterns at each experience level
- Bugs and issues are intentionally realistic for each skill level
- Focus is on demonstrating progression, not perfect solutions
